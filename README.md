## Goals
- Provide students with hands-on, immersive practice
- Teach crime scene documentation in an immersive experience
- Develop intuitive VR interaction systems
- Provide students with real-world XR development experience

## Purpose
- Teach ethical, accurate, and observational journalism in high-pressure settings
- Provide students with hands-on, immersive practice
- Reinforce best practices in note-taking, interviewing, and narrative building

## Technology

## Development Updates

### Update 1 — Pre-Planning Phase (March 31, 2025)
This phase focused on idea development and research, handled solo by J. Sailor Usher.

- **Project Framing:** Designed the experience around the concept of “learning by doing” in VR.
- **Target Outcome:** Help students feel confident and curious when assessing evidence.
- **Key Considerations:**
  - Focus on realism without being graphic or disturbing.
  - Encourage decision-making and attention to detail.
  - Scene reactivity based on observation and interaction.

Next: Planning and kickoff with Robert-Abel and Vincent.
